Place 100 g (3% 02) caster sugar and 25 ml (1 oz) water into a saucepan on medium to high heat. As the mixture turns the colour of caramel, add 100 ml (3½ oz) red wine vinegar and 100 g (3% oz) quartered strawberries. Heat until it has reduced by half. Strain through a mesh strainer, using a muddler to drain out all of the juice. Add a pinch of salt and funnel into a bottle. Keep for up to 12 weeks in the refrigerator. Approx. 15 servings.
