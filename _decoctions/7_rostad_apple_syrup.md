Combine 5 g (1 tsp) caster sugar and 2 g (1 tsp) ground cinnamon in a medium bowl. Add
1 apple, cored and sliced, tossing the pieces around in the mixture to fully coat both sides.
Spread the apples in a single layer on a baking tray. Bake at 175°C (350°F) for 12 minutes,
flipping halfway through. Combine three-quarters of the roasted apples with 150 g (5 oz)
caster sugar and 100 ml (3½ oz) water in a saucepan. Place on medium heat with a lid on,
stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, let cool, then fine-mesh strain and
funnel into a bottle. Keep the remaining roasted apples to garnish. Keep for up to 2 weeks
in the refrigerator. Approx. 10 servings.
